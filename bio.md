I'd say a file storage product based on content-adressable storage system
(hosted on Riak). Everything is streamed, from the frontend to the storage, so
it is able to handle huge files without any issues. All the metadata is stored
in an immutable graph, with a log of all the transformations allowing to
quickly compute diffs between two states of the system.
