# Functional patterns for scala beginners

## Short

Scala, by being both Functional and Object-Oriented is easy to get started
with, especially for java developpers. However, to get the most of the
language, you have to embrace its functional nature.


In this session, I'll show you how to start using scala's functional nature by
presenting patterns originated in the functional world:

 - Substitution model and "everything is an expression"
 - Algebraic Data Types for data modelling 
 - Typeclasses for extensible abstractions
 - Error handling in a composable fashion with Either and Validation
 - Segregation between logic and effects for easier testing
 - Property based testing

## Commentary

This talk targets the scala beginners: the goal is to show them fp idioms in
scala. People coming to scala from java spend some time stuck in an
intermediate state where they still use java knowledge to design scala
applications. The talk intends to reduce the time spent "writing java in
scala" by showing attendees how to use scala idioms to great effect.

It will also help people recognize these patterns in widely used frameworks
and libraries (eg typeclasses in play framework)

The talk is targeted at beginners.

## Talk history

I've spent some time bootstrapping the scala community in Nantes. I've trained
and worked with a few developpers beginning with FP. The talk is a collection
of advice I regularly give to people picking up FP with scala.

I've given it at flatMap 2015 in Oslo
