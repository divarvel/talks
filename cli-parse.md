# CLI parsing with CLI Parse

## Short

I've been working on a CLI application in node for the last few weeks. It's
designed for demanding clients, so it has to bee polished (clear output,
consistent help, autocompletion). I've explored a bit the landscape of what is
possible and easy to do with existing libraries.

In this talk I'll explain common CLI idioms (command pattern, option short
hands, help tags, â€¦) as well as help display and autocompletion.

I'll show how to do basic parsing with minimist as well as a more complete
application (commands, subcommands, autocompletion) with CLI Parse.

Disclaimer: I wrote CLI Parse.
